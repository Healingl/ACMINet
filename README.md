# ACMINet

The Pytorch implementation of *"A 3D Cross-Modality Feature Interaction Network With Volumetric Feature Alignment for Brain Tumor and Tissue Segmentation"* on the BrainTS2020 dataset.




## Requirements

Experiments were performed on an Ubuntu 18.04 workstation with two 24G NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs , CUDA 11.1, and install the virtual environment (python3.8) by:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The Ranger optimizer is used in this project, and install it by the following project:

## Implementation

### Data download

Download the [BraTS2020](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2020/) dataset and change data config:

```
vim ./src/path_config.py
# training dataset
BRATS_TRAIN_FOLDERS = "./xx/MICCAI_BraTS2020_TrainingData/"
# validation dataset
BRATS_VAL_FOLDER = "./xx/MICCAI_BraTS2020_ValidationData/"
# test dataset 
BRATS_TEST_FOLDER = "./xx/MICCAI_BraTS2020_Data_Testing/"

```



### Training and Predicting

Run different models and change the '--fold' parameters to select the cross-validation fold (0 to 4)ï¼š

```
sh train_models.sh
```

Predicting the validation data by multi-model ensemble:

```
python step2_inference.py --devices 0 --on val --tta
```
